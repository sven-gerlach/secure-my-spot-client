# The only way I have uncovered by which env vars can be transported into the react runtime environment is as follows:
# 1) store the env as a secure var on GitHub
# 2) collect the env inside the GitHub actions yml using the env (either inside a job or as part of the module)
# 3) in the GitHub actions yml pass the env var onto the docker_build_args variable provided by the Heroku deploy
# template from akhileshns/heroku-deploy
# 4) collect the arg inside the Dockerfile and pass the arg onto an ENV var (this must happen before the react build
# command as react will include all env vars at build time)

# by default nginx listens to port 80
# however, Heroku provides the PORT as an environment variable and which is subject to change
# specify the root (index.html) and the port which nginx needs to listen on in nginx-setup.conf
# replace the contents of nginx' default.conf with nginx-setup.conf
COPY nginx-setup.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf

# use bash stream editor to replace PORT inside default.conf with Heroku's $PORT param at run-time
# Since the PORT is only stipulated by Heroku at run-time and not when the container is built CMD must be used
# -i -> in-place
# -e -> append editing commands to the list of commands
# replace PORT in default.conf with $PORT variable
# "damon off" keeps nginx running in foreground and prevents container from closing down
# alternatively to sed, envsubst apk could be used and might actually be a cleaner solution
